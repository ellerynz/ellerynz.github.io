My bench press had stale-mated due to a focus on legs. It was mostly bouncing around the 110kg mark. I wanted to jack-up my bench by doing a lil' Smolov cycle. It only takes three weeks so a perfect fitness goal for January.

## Smolov Jr.
With my current 1 rep max for bench at 110kg (not that great but it's with a pause), I punched that into [this](http://www.smolovjr.com/smolov-calculator/) calculator and got my routine. Added a lot of stretching, light rows, and pulls/chins too.

#### First week
  First few workouts were a piece of piss and raised a few questions. Had I gone too light? Was the first week meant to be easy? Should I add exercises? I figured I'd stick with it considering it's meant to get harder.

#### Second week
  Again, first couple were easy, then got a little more difficult. Legs loving the break.

#### Third week
  Now here's where things got hard. Third workout had my chest and triceps cramping up pretty bad. Final workout was also quite the challenge. Legs aching for a workout.

#### Fourth week
  Warmed up with OHPs and chinups which I soon regretted. Bench was going good but quickly tired out. Did 110 easy. Slowly incremented up to 120kg. Felt like I could have done more but my chest and arms were too tired at that point so didn't push any further. 120kg felt pretty damn comfortable though.

  Also, in the fourth week I finally gave my legs a workout! Best DOMs I've had in a long time. Monday's leg workout lasted til Friday. Didn't try and max out my squat or anything, just high reps. Legs still felt strong/capable though.

Feburary's fitness goal is to hit 120kg bench once per week on chest days.
